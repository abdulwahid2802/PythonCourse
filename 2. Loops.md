# Loops
---
Loops are used in programming to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met. 

In this article we will cover below outlines:
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `break` statement
- `continue` statement

## The "for" loops

For loops iterate over a given sequence of numbers

```py
evenNums = [2, 4, 6, 8]
for evenNum in evenNums:
  print(prime)
```

For loops can be iterated using built-in function `range`. 

```py
for x in range(3)
  print(x)
  
// output: 0,1,2
```

And if 2 numbers given as an argument it will be the numbers between them.

```py
for x in range(5,9):
    print(x)
    
// output: 5,6,7,8
```

## "while" loops

While continues untill certain boolean condtion is met. 

```py
i = 0
while i < 4
  print(i)
  i += 1

// output: 0,1,2,3
```

## "continue" and "break" statements

`continue` statement is used to skip the current block if given condition is true, where "break" statement is used to exit
the loop if certain condition is met. The difference is in `continue` statement, only one time iteration will be skiped while 
not exiting from the loop.

```py
i = 0

for i in range(1,10):
  if(i%2===0):
    break
```

Above code exits if there is even number.

```py
i = 0

for i in range(1,10):
  if(i%2===0):
    continue
   print(i)
```

Above code skips even numbers and printing odd numbers.


### Problem

Define a `for` loop, which should iterate between 1, 10 numbers (you can use built-in function), loop should be exited when
variable reaches 5.

# Functions
---

Functions give us a chance to divide our code into useful blocks, which makes it readable and shareable. 

In this article we will learn:
 - How to define a function
 - How to call a function
 
 Functions in python are defined with a ***function name*** following by ***def*** keyword. 
 
 ```py
 
 def myFunction():
  print("My name is John")
  
```
Parantheses after ***function name*** is used for defining argument(s) for this function.

> ***arguments*** are variables which passed from caller of the function

```py

def myFunction(name):
  print("My name is %s"%(name))

```

Functions can also return value to the caller using `return` keyword

```py

def multiplyTwo(a,b):
  return a*b
  
```
In above case, `multiplyTwo` function returns the result of `a*b`.

## Calling a function

Calling a function is easier than define one, you simply write function name followed with `()`.

```py

myFunction();

myFunction("John");

multiplyTwo(2,3);
```

We can assign those callers to variables

```py

x = multiplyTwo(2,3);

print(x)

```

## Problem

Define a function called ***userData***, give arguments like ***name, birthDate, profession*** and call this function.
